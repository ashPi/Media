# Media
A basic prototype of a media playing app which unfortunately doesn't work with actual media files but with text file entries.

The user has an option to create an account or to log in; there is a freebies library and option to purchase more media files (music, movies or series). The user has a wallet which he/she can top up and an option to save or load media playlists.

The app is very basic and is not fully developed and completed
